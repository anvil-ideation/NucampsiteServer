Hello,

Below you will find my GitHub repository:
https://github.com/anvil-ideation/nucampsiteServer

With .gitignore, both the npm packages and the "hidden" files were made inaccessible, to slim the application folder and also to protect certain information, like the Facebook app secret code.
Should these be needed for any reason, please let me know. Also, I included the bonus portion of the workshop for cross-checking to see if a campsite existed before it could be added as a favorite. This additional code should only be present in the two POST methods for favorites, as part of conditional statements, and should not impact the other code associated with the workshop outside of creating additional conditional paths to take.

If you have ay questions or need further files or code from me, you can reach me at landon@anvilideation.com

Best,
Landon
